# AID-Scripts

## Scripts for AI Dungeon
Currently the core scripts are just the framework with a non-working (in the sense that the result isn't displayed - it's a work in progress) dice roller.

## EWIJSON-mods
Mods designed to be added to EWIJSON

## Framework
My efforts at building a modular framework that easily allows for a combination of plugins. It is not feature-complete and has only been designed with my dice roller mod in mind, so this should be considered a Proof of Concept rather than something for general use.
